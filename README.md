# Personal-VBA-Library (Excel 365)

This is a repository of all the VBA Macros that I have written either for myself or school. The purpose of this repository is to help me store an online version of the code as well as showcase what I have learnt in VBA so far.

As I am still a student, I expect that updating this Repo will be on a cyclical basis - I expect to update it more often during the Winter and Summer breaks as compared to the rest of the year.
